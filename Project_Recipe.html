            <li>2 and 3/4 cups (345 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup (230 grams) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup (200 grams) brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs room temperature</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 12-ounce package (2 cups) semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
         <h2><b>Instructions</b></h2>
        <ol> <!-- Instructrions on how to make chocolate chip cookies -->
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large mixing bowl using an electric mixer, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar for 1-2 minutes until well combined. Add in the eggs and vanilla extract one at a time and mix until fully combined.</li>
            <li>Slowly mix in the flour mixture and continue mixing until just combined, then mix in the chocolate chips, making sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.</li>
            <li>Cover the cookie dough tightly and transfer to the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Once the dough is almost chilled, preheat the oven to 350°F. Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats and set aside.</li>
            <li>Remove the cookie dough from the refrigerator, using a 1.5-2 tablespoon cookie scoop, scoop the cookie dough and drop onto the prepared baking sheets. Make sure to leave a little room between each ball of cookie dough as they will spread a little while they bake.</li>
            <li>Bake in separate batches at 350°F for 10-12 minutes or until the edges of the cookies are lightly golden brown and the top is set. Remove from the oven and cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer the cookies to a wire rack to finish cooling.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Prep Time: 2 hours 15 minutes, Cook Time: 12 minutes</p>
